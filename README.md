# Enterprise IAM Lab

> A comprehensive hands-on implementation of enterprise-grade Identity and Access Management solutions, designed to demonstrate real-world skills and best practices.

## Project Overview

This repository documents my journey building a production-ready IAM infrastructure from scratch. The project simulates a medium-enterprise environment (500-1000 users) and implements industry-standard identity management practices using Microsoft technologies with future multi-vendor integration.

**Target Audience:** IT professionals, system administrators, and security engineers looking to understand enterprise IAM implementation.

## Architecture

The lab environment implements a hybrid identity architecture connecting on-premises and cloud infrastructure:

- **On-Premises**: Windows Server 2022 Active Directory Domain Services
- **Cloud Identity**: Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)  
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Azure AD Connect with seamless SSO
- **Security Layer**: Conditional Access, MFA, and Privileged Identity Management
- **Future Integration**: OKTA Universal Directory and adaptive authentication

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Identity Directory** | Windows Active Directory | On-premises user and computer management |
| **Cloud Identity** | Microsoft Entra ID | Cloud-based identity and access management |
| **Hybrid Sync** | Azure AD Connect | Directory synchronization and SSO |
| **Infrastructure** | Azure, VMware | Cloud and virtualized infrastructure |
| **Automation** | PowerShell, Azure CLI | Infrastructure as Code and administration |
| **Documentation** | Markdown, Diagrams | Comprehensive implementation guides |

## Implementation Phases

- [ ] Audit logging and monitoring
- [ ] Compliance reporting

### Phase 6: Advanced Integration (Future)
- [ ] OKTA Universal Directory integration
- [ ] API management and automation
- [ ] Cross-platform identity federation
- [ ] Advanced security analytics
